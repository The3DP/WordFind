How to properly use and download neccasary software to use each code properly.
If one of the supported codes is a code reconized and used by you, then you should probaly already know how to use that code.

NO DATA is here at this moment. However, that will eventually change.

for COBOL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use COBOL:

You'll need a COBOL compiler to convert your COBOL code into executable machine code. Some options for COBOL compilers are:

GnuCOBOL (Free and open-source, supports multiple platforms)
Micro Focus COBOL (Commercial but widely used in the industry)
IBM COBOL (For mainframes)
OpenCOBOL (Another free, open-source COBOL implementation)
2. Writing COBOL Code
COBOL code can be written in any text editor (Notepad, VSCode, etc.), but it’s best to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed for COBOL, such as:

Visual Studio Code with COBOL extensions
Eclim (a plugin for Eclipse for COBOL support)
Cobol-IT Studio
Here’s a basic COBOL program to give you an idea:

cobol
Copy
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. HelloWorld.
       AUTHOR. Your Name.
       DATE-WRITTEN. 2025-03-03.
       ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
       DATA DIVISION.
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
       01  WS-NAME        PIC A(10).
       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       DISPLAY "Enter your name: ".
       ACCEPT WS-NAME.
       DISPLAY "Hello, " WS-NAME "!".
       STOP RUN.
3. Compiling COBOL Code
After writing the COBOL program, you need to compile it. The command for compiling depends on the compiler you're using. For example:

Using GnuCOBOL (OpenCOBOL): If you’ve installed GnuCOBOL, save your code in a file called helloworld.cob. You can compile it using the command:

nginx
Copy
cobc -x helloworld.cob
This creates an executable file (helloworld) that you can run.

Using Micro Focus COBOL: You would usually use the provided development environment or command-line tools to compile the code, such as:

nginx
Copy
cob -x helloworld.cob
Using IBM COBOL: The process on IBM mainframes is more complex but typically involves using the IEFBR14 or COBOL commands depending on the environment.

4. Running the Program
After compiling, you can run the generated executable. For example:

On GnuCOBOL:
bash
Copy
./helloworld
On Micro Focus or other compilers, you might use a similar command, depending on the environment.
5. Debugging and Testing
If there are any errors, they’ll be shown after you attempt to compile or run the program. Pay attention to error messages and fix your code accordingly.

6. Example in Practice
Here’s an example of what the whole process might look like using GnuCOBOL:

Install GnuCOBOL (if you don’t have it installed, you can install it on Linux with the following command):

arduino
Copy
sudo apt install open-cobol
Create a COBOL Program: Save the following code into a file named hello.cob:

cobol
Copy
